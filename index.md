### Data Science

[Dungeons & Dragons Race Classification](/dnd-race-classification.md)

* Utilized **Machine Learning** techniques with **Scikit-learn** to predict character races based on ability scores and features from a Dungeons & Dragons dataset.
* Explored various models for selection, **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **AdaBoost Classifier**.

* Conducted in-depth **feature analysis** and **model evaluation**.
* Fine-tuned hyperparameters of the best performing classfier through manual tuning, **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV**.
* Achieved an **accuracy of 67.25%** in predicting character races, improving on **51.8%** from the initial dataset.

[Zombie Survival Game](/zombie-survival.md/)
* Developed a Python-based Zombie Survival Game, the mechanics involve managing resources, mission outcomes, and end-of-day round Zombie attacks.
* **Object-oriented programming** in Python to create Class Models for Camp, Locations, and Players.
* Utilized smaller functions for specific game mechanics and larger functions to implement and run game flow, mission outcomes, and end-of-round events.
* Employed **random library** and computer decision logic trees for computer-controlled players.
